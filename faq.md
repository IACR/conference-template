### How do I change the dates and times for the countdowns to important dates that appear on the index and call for papers pages?
In /js/cryptoCountdowns.js. Make sure that times are in UTC. You can use this converter: [http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/].

When changing the dates for countdown timers, don't forget to also change the dates in index.html. They are in ```<p class="dateTitle">``` tags.
