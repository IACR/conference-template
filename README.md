# Conference Website Template
This is a freelance project for IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research). If you're trying to install this, please refer to [installation.md](/installation.md).

Currently live preview at (http://geekscat.com/iacr-demo). This site is meant to be reusable and could easily be adapted for your conference. Please contact me directly at kayasmckelly at gmail dot com for more info on usage rights.

Current conferences using this site template include:
- [PKC 2018](https://pkc.iacr.org/2018/)
- [Eurocrypt 2018](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2018)
- [FSE 2018](https://fse.iacr.org/2018/)
- [Crypto 2018](https://crypto.iacr.org/2018)
- [Asiacrypt 2017](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2017/)

Please note that these sites may have been modified slightly from the original design and are currently being maintained by the conference organizers.

IACR requested a makeover of their conference website, with the main
concerns that it would be mobile friendly and look more modern. Their
intention is to use this as a template for future conferences,
including Crypto, Asiacrypt, and Eurocrypt. Data for a given conference is largely contained in JSON files, including the dates, name of conference, location, program, committee names, etc.
