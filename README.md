# Crypto 2016
This is a freelance project for IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research).

They requested a makeover of their conference website, with the main concerns that it would be mobile friendly and look more modern. Their intention is to use this as a template for future conferences, including Crypto, Asiacrypt, and Eurocrypt.
