# Conference Website Template
This is a freelance project for IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research). If you're trying to install this, please refer to (/installation.md).

Currently live preview at (http://geekscat.com/iacr)

They requested a makeover of their conference website, with the main
concerns that it would be mobile friendly and look more modern. Their
intention is to use this as a template for future conferences,
including Crypto, Asiacrypt, and Eurocrypt. Data for a conference is in
the metadata.json file, such as the dates, name of conference, location, etc.

For comparison, here's a screenshot of the 2016 website (the last year before I was commissioned to improve the site):
