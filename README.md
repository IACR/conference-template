# Conference Website Template
This is a freelance project for IACR (International Association for Cryptologic Research). If you're trying to install this, please refer to [installation.md](/installation.md). Please note that you will need to clone a specific branch (choose the one whose name matches your conference). More info in the installation docs.

Currently live preview at (http://geekscat.com/iacr-demo). This site is meant to be reusable and could easily be adapted for your conference. Please contact me directly at kayasmckelly at gmail dot com for more info on usage rights.

IACR requested a makeover of their conference website, with the main
concerns that it would be mobile friendly and look more modern. Their
intention is to use this as a template for future conferences,
including Crypto, Asiacrypt, and Eurocrypt. Data for a given conference is largely contained in JSON files, including the dates, name of conference, location, program, committee names, etc.

For comparison, here's a screenshot of the 2016 website (the last year before I was commissioned to improve the site):
