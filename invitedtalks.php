            Systems for sustainable blockchains: proofs of space and verifiable

            Abstract
          </h4>
          <p>
            The distinctive feature of Bitcoin is that it achieves
            decentralisation in an open setting where everyone can join. This
            is achieved at a high price, honest parties must constantly
            dedicate more computational power towards securing Bitcoin's
            blockchain than is available to a potential adversary, which leads
            to a massive waste of energy; at its hitherto peak, the electricity
            used for Bitcoin mining equaled the electricity consumption of
            Austria. In this lecture I will discuss how disk-space, instead of
            computation, can be used as a resource to construct a more
            sustainable blockchain. We will see definitions and constructions
            of "proof of space" and "verifiable delay functions", and how they
            can be used to construct a Blockchain with similar dynamics and
            security properties as the Bitcoin blockchain.

          <p>
            Krzysztof Pietrzak received his masters and PhD from ETH Zurich,
            then did postdocs at ENS Paris and CWI Amsterdam. Since 2011 he
            heads the cryptography group at the recently founded Institute of
            Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria). He is interested in
            theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography, including
            pseudorandomness/entropy, (black-box) lower bounds,
            leakage-resilience, memory-hard functions, crypto for light-weight
            devices and proof systems for sustainable blockchains. He is the
            recipient of an ERC starting and consolidator grant and three
            Eurocrypt best paper awards.

            Streamlined blockchains: A simple and elegant approach (tutorial)
          </p>
          <h4 class="subSubtitle">
            Abstract
          </h4>
          <p>
            A blockchain protocol (also called state machine replication)
            allows a set of nodes to agree on an ever-growing, linearly ordered
            log of transactions. In this tutorial, we present a new paradigm
            called “streamlined blockchains”. This paradigm enables a new
            family of protocols that are extremely simple and natural: every
            epoch, a proposer proposes a block extending from a notarized
            parent chain, and nodes vote if the proposal’s parent chain is not
            too old. Whenever a block gains enough votes, it becomes notarized.
            Whenever a node observes a notarized chain with several blocks of
            consecutive epochs at the end, then the entire chain chopping off a
            few blocks at the end is final. By varying the parameters
            highlighted in blue, we illustrate two variants for the partially
            synchronous and synchronous settings respectively. We present very
            simple proofs of consistency and liveness. We hope that this
            tutorial provides a compelling argument why this new family of
            protocols should be used in lieu of classical candidates (e.g.
            PBFT, Paxos, and their variants), both in practical implementation
            and for pedagogical purposes.
