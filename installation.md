# Installation
### Pre-installation
- Make sure you have git installed on the server where you plan to deploy the conference site

### Getting the site on the server
- Log into the server
- Type ```git clone https://github.com/kaymckelly/freelance-iacr.git``` You should now have a directory called /freelance-iacr on the server. You can change the name of the directory at this point if you like.

### Changing the conference names/dates/location
- Open /json/metadata.json. Editing this will change the places where this text would appear throughout all pages.

### Changing the names of the program committee
- Open /json/comm.json. Editing this will change the places where this text would appear throughout all pages.
- Please remember that first names should be included as they appear on the papers, rather than first initials. If there are accents in the name or institution, make sure to use the correct unicode character.
