        Affiliated Events
      </h2>
      <p>
        IACR is soliciting for affiliated events to be held in
        conjunction with <?php echo $META['shortName'];?> on
        <span class="editMe">Saturday, August 15, and/or Sunday, August 16</span>.
        Each such event is expected to provide a forum discussing a
        specific topic of the broad cryptographic world (theory, practice,
        implementation, standardizations, etc.). The format of the event
        (e.g., workshop, tutorial, etc.) is up to the organizers.
      </p>

     <h3 class="pageSubtitle">
       Call for Affiliated Events
     </h3>
      <p>
        Affiliated events can be 1-2 days long.
        Proposals for events should be submitted by email to the workshop
        chair at <span class="editMe">***insert email address of affiliated
        workshops person*** by DATE & TIME</span>.
      </p>
      <!-- <span class="editMe">
        <p>
  	      The workshop organizers will provide for each event:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conference room with a projector</li>
          <li>Coffee breaks (lunch will be provided at the attendeesâ€™ expense at UCSB food services)</li>
          <li>Internet access</li>
          <li>Registration services (registration desk, nametags, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </span> -->

      <h4 class="subSubtitle">
        Information to Submitters
      </h4>
      <p>
        The organization of an affiliated event is supposed to be
        relatively easy. <span class="editMe">The entire registration process as well as
        the local organization is done by the IACR (via
        the general and workshop
        chairs).</span> The proposal submitters need to identify a topic and
        decide on the format, and upon acceptance coordinate the
        program/speakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The registration fee for attendees of affiliated events will be charged
        via the registration process and will cover the incurred costs for the
        location and equipment. Being registered for a given day of workshop
        enables a participant to attend any of the workshops of that particular
        day.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Any additional costs (e.g. costs of the program,
      	reimbursements to invited speakers, or printing proceedings)
      	are the responsibility of the individual event
      	organizers.
      </p>
      <t>
        The organizers of the accepted events are expected to maintain an
        updated website (which will be linked from the <?php echo
        $META['shortName'];?> website), containing all relevant information for
        participants.
      </p>

        Proposal Evaluation Criteria
      </h4>
      <p>
        Given the limited amount of conference rooms available, events
        will be selected based on their novelty, importance, and
        interest that they may have in the cryptographic
        community. The agreement of leading members of the
        cryptographic community to engage with the event (as
        speakers or committee members) will be taken into account.
