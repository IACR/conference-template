            The Cryptography Research Fund allows us to waive the registration fee for all student presenters of an accepted paper. A limited number of stipends will be available to those students unable to obtain funding to attend the conference, and to students who have an accepted paper that they will present. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. To apply, please ask your PhD supervisor or Department Head to email a brief justification  to the <a href="./contact.html">General Chair</a>.

          <!-- <p>
               Notifications of stipends went out on DATE, but it's not too late! If you applied and didn't hear anything, send the general chair an email. We also have quite a few stipends still available for students at US universities, either undergraduate or graduate. Email the general chair.
